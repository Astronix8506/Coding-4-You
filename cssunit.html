                            Our first lesson will cover how to color your text using CSS.
                            This is a fairly basic action, but it'll be EXTREMELY useful if you
                            want to make your text really POP!
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class = "content-spacing">
                    <div class = "content-header main-flex-item" >
                        <h1>How It Works...</h1>
                    </div>
                    <div class = "body-content main-flex-item" >
                        <p id="test-text">
                            In order to change the color of your text, you're going to need 
                            to use the built-in CSS 'color:' property. Simply call whatever 
                            section of your HTML document the text is in, and type, 
                            "color: [Insert Color Here]". 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            To enter a color value, you can 
                            either type the name of it (such as red or blue), use an RGB value ("rgb(255, 0, 0)"), 
                            or input a HEX value ("#ff0000"). For further clarification, look at the example below!

                            In this lesson, you will learn how to change your text to whatever font you'd like!

                            <br>
                            Even if that's comic sans...

                <div class = "content-spacing">
                    <div class = "content-header main-flex-item" >

                            So, just like you did for the text color, you'll want to call whatever section 
                            of the document that your text resides in. Now, in order to change your font, 
                            you'll want to use the 'font-family:' property. This property is used to change 
                            the font to what you want it to be, while also providing some backups for other devices 
                            that possibly can't load that font. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The format for this property is, 
                            "font-family: [font], [font], [font]". The first font entered will be 
                            the one that's mainly used, and the other 2 are your backups. 
                            If you don't understand what I mean, look at the example below!

                        <p id="test-text">
                            After this lesson, you'll know exactly how the 'padding' and 'margin' properties work in CSS!
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                        <p id="test-text">
                            First of all, let's start with the 'padding' property. Using the CSS Box Model as 
                            an example, think of padding like the space inside a box. Padding determines the 
                            space between the content inside the box and the border around it. To use padding, 
                            you simply need to type, "padding: [top value], [right value], [bottom value], [left value]".
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            As for margin, think of it as the space outside of the borders of a box. To use this, type, 
                            "margin: [top value], [right value], [bottom value], [left value]".
                        </p>

                            A border, in terms of CSS, is the outline to an object. Borders help 
                            to make boxes and other shapes feel less plain-looking. So, how do 
                            you add a border? 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Well, it's as simple as typing, 
                            "border: [thickness], [type] [color]"! 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Now, there's some things to clarify here. 
                            First of all, the thickness property can just be something as simple as '25px'. 
                            However, the type of border can either be 'dotted', 'dashed', 'solid' or 'double'. 
                            That specification defines how the border itself will look. And, 
                            obviously there's the color properties.
