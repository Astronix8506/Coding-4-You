                            In every HTML document, there is the same basic skeleton. 
                            This skeleton (outline) consists of a head and a body.
                            <br>
                            <br> 
                            The head stores data that tells the computers and other 
                            machines that read the code how to function, but not things 
                            that are displayed on the page itself.
                            As for how to set up the head, simply use the 'head' tag 
                            after the Doc Type is clarified.

                            As for the body, 
                            the body holds everything that you see on the actual HTML webpage, 
                            including titles and text boxes.
                            As for how to set up the body, simply use the 'body' tag after the 
                            'head' tag in the HTML document.

                            A header tag is one of many tags that tell the computer 
                            that you want to write text into the HTML document to be 
                            displayed on the webpage. In this case, these tags display 
                            headers to the page with 6 different levels of headings. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The first level is meant to be used for the most important 
                            information, whereas the sixth is for the least crucial. 
                            The way that you type out these tags (which go in the body 
                            section of the document) is by typing, 'h1', 'h2', 'h3', etc.

                            A div tag is best defined as a container for any HTML elements you want 
                            to group together. This is mainly used for the purpose of giving said 
                            div tag a class or id in order to use in the stylesheet. We'll talk 
                            about classes and id's later, however.

                            <br>
                            The way to write a div tag is 
                            to type out "div" and then type out any html elements such as 
                            headers or paragraphs inside of it.

                            We've mentioned classes and id's previously, but 
                            here is where you'll really gain an understanding 
                            for them.

                            Classes and id's are generally used in order to call an entire 
                            group of elements in a stylesheet so you don't have to individually 
                            type out each one. Classes and id's are slightly different from eachother, however;
                            Classes are able to be assigned to various HTML elements, whereas id's 
                            are a single-use type of thing. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            In order to assign a class or id, 
                            simply go into a div tag or any tag that contains a group of elements, 
                            and type out "[class or id] = 'name'". From there, you can simply call 
                            the class by typing out ".[name of class]" in the CSS document, 
                            or get an id by typing out "#[name of id]".
